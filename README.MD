Does it mean its death? Of course not! It has been reborn! I brought it back to life!
Now it is called LookOut (fix version) and works with all new Thunderbird versions.

LookOut (fix version) - based on last version LookOut+ 1.2.15 by Attila K. Mergl (Last Updated: October 15, 2013)

Please before use, remove or disable the original LookOut and LookOut+ !

## What is LookOut?

LookOut is a plugin which allows Thunderbird (and SeaMonkey) to interface with Microsoft's mail tools by decoding metadata and attachments encapsulated/embedded in a TNEF encoded attachment (aka winmail.dat).
The TNEF decoding engine was inspired (with permission) by the TNEF project. LookOut has a full MAPI decoder and the ability to transcode some of those properties to iCalendar (ics) and vCard (vcf) formats.
As an option all MAPI properties within a email can be viewed so other types of information can be deciphered.

# Debugging

const debugLevel = 5; //MKA Set 5 to switch off 10 to enable debugging;

```
